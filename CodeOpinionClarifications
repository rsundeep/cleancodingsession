### 25 Color Code Mannual

Opinion:

can cause out of bounds issue in case the boundary condition in for loop is not properly done
The size of the array is just counted manually which would cause a problem if the size is more
for each j times, each element gets printed 5 times
code is bit complex to visualize and find the actual issue.
more in a traditional c style
