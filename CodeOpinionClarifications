### 25 Color Code Mannual
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:25_pair_color_code_chart.svg

My Opinion:
Can cause out of bounds issue in case the boundary condition in for loop is not properly done
The size of the array is just counted manually which would cause a problem if the size is more
The size condition in two for loops is manually kept as 5 which is confusing for a new programmer
For each j times, each element gets printed 5 times
Code is bit complex to visualize and find the actual issue.
More in a traditional c style
