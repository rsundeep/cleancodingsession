### 25 Color Code Mannual
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:25_pair_color_code_chart.svg

My Opinion:
Can cause out of bounds issue in case the boundary condition in for loop is not properly done
The size of the array is just counted manually which is prone to issues
The size condition in two for loops is kept as 5 which is confusing for a new programmer of how the value 5 is derived
For each j times, each element gets printed 5 times which might not be the intention of the coder/developer
Code is bit complex to visualize and find the actual issue.
More in a traditional c style
